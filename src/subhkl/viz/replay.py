"""Rebuild the unrolled-detector plots from HDF5 output, without reprocessing.

`finder` and `rbf-integrator` render their plots while they run, from data that
exists only for the duration of the run.  Switching the plots off to save the
rendering time and the disk space therefore also throws away the only way to
look at the result, short of repeating the search.

Nothing in those plots actually requires the search, though.  Every layer is
either in the peaks file the search writes -- the peak centres in pixel
coordinates, and their fitted widths -- or in the reduced (and optionally
merged) image file the search read, which holds the frames themselves and the
bank each one belongs to.  So the plots can be rebuilt afterwards from that
pair of files, and this module does exactly that: it reassembles the same
inputs the inline paths assemble and hands them to the same renderer, so a
replayed plot is the plot the run would have made.

The peaks file addresses images by `peaks/image_index`, which indexes the image
stack of the file the search ran on.  Pointing this at a *different* image file
is the one mistake that would produce a wrong picture rather than an error, so
the indices are checked against the stack before anything is drawn.
